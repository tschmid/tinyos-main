This is a test application that shows how to use the ADE7753 power metering
chip. We assume that you use a Sam3s-ek evaluation development kit. You have
to make the following modifications to the kit:
- remove resistors: R26, R27, R28, R31, R33, R34, R35, R36, R37 (all on the
  top side near the serial DB9 USART connector)
- remove capacitor C46 (on the bottom side, opposit of the Sam3s Chip
  footprint).
- solder a wire to pin 74 of the Sam3s chip. Note that numbered through
  holes are provided for this!

Connect the ADE775 chip as follows:
- DVDD (5V) -> J12.1
- \RESET    -> J12.2
- DIN       -> PA13
- DOUT      -> PA12 (Add a 10k resistor in series because we go from 5V to
                     3.3V!)
- SCLK      -> PA14
- \CS       -> PA22
- \IRQ      -> PA21
- ZX        -> PA0 (This is the wire you soldered to pin 74!)
- GND       -> Any GND pin, e.g. J12.37
